# Why Work for Penske?

## Reservations

Initially, I had felt unsure about working with a publishing and affinity marketing corporation.  The reason being that the power to influence affinity groups frightens me.  The ability of media corporations to promote buzz-worthy and viral content that further divides social groups --in what feels like an ever dividing society-- is often manipulated for purposes I do not support.

I then reviewed the content produced by Penske brands.  Rolling stone especially stands out.  The editorial team is able to analyze the broader impact of viral pop culture moments on socio-political norms. Today, featured articles include a biopic of King Princess, a Sandy Hook mother's views on gun violence, and Tucker Carlson's tirade against the BTS appearance at the White House.  In other words, articles normalizing nontraditional gender orientations, analyzing gun violence, and identifying anti-asian bias presented by a spectrum of the American media.  Topics that would be the norm for any political science or sociology journal, but presented in a way that resonates with the broader public.  

Yes, products are marketed, but ideas are also subtly presented to the reader in order to challenge bias and promote social cohesion amongst niche groups.  The approach actually challenged my own bias towards marketing in general.  People identify with the brands they choose to purchase. We seem to make that choice according to the perceived value system of that brand.  In general, what we choose to purchase relays to others our own value systems.  In promoting brands that align with a value set, an organization like Penske can normalize diversity, cosmopolitanism, and conscientious individualism. 

## What I Bring to Penske

I already revealed my political affinity.  I revealed my value system.  I am often afraid of doing so, especially in a professional setting.  That said, I believe it is important to work for a company that is aware of my values, but does not feel threatened by them. I want the best ideas to win.  I want to act truthfully. 

The digital analyst role is technical.  Nonetheless, I feel it is important to quantify the social response to ideas in order for the editorial teams to produce shareable and challenging content.  To me, analyzing data means numerically capturing social attitudes and affinities to pragmatically interact with consumers.  It is comparable to having conversations with millions of people via an abstract numerical language.  In my role, I will ensure that I rigorously produce valid analysis by considering every individual story within the data. 

I studied logistic regression models of Supreme Court Justice affinity towards political ideologies.  I later studied experimental design and computational statistics. I published a data set of human right abuses presented at the Hague's International Criminal Court.  I built a marketing CRM for a public health organization. I founded a company to build analytical data pipelines.  In short, I possess the technical skillset for the job.  What I do not know now, I will learn.  

Apart from technical ability, I am driven by a value set that compels me to produce the best work possible by considering as many ideas as possible.  I believe individual ability is improved by collaborating with others of diverse backgrounds.  A global citizen or cosmopolitan must accept cultural and historical differences to determine a common language in promotion of cooperation.  I try to embody that ideal.  I would say Penske does as well.  

## Answering the Question


Despite my initial reservations, I feel confident that I will find at Penske a community of professionals that will challenge me.  I hope to be able to improve my skillset by working on difficult analysis and data engineering problems. 

I find also, that contributing to the global conversation is attractive me.  It is not necessarily buzz, but the conversation regarding social norms, political ideology, and in general culture that I find interesting.  The romantic part of me identifies with Hemingway, Sartre, Foucault, and Guibert.  The impact of their journalistic work is still important today.  Digital media has the same potential to influence, simply by different means.
 
I had thought that I would pursue a career in academic research.  I chose not to pursue that path because the confines of academic publishing did not appeal to my general interest in demographic research. 

Digital media and publishing is social research in action.  It is the front line of the epistemic community.  It is where ideas can be presented to and challenged by the people most affected by the consequences of actualized value systems.  I want to meet their needs by creating actionable insights content creators can use to contribute to our global conversation and culture.
