# # Part 1: BigQuery and SQL

# ## Python Solutions
# 

# To test my sql queries I wrote python scripts to interface directly with the Big Query API.  This permitted me to run a test driven development environment to automate most of the work.  

# ### Import Statements

# In[1]:


from google.cloud import bigquery
from pprint import pprint
import os


# ### Utility Big Query Function

# In[2]:


def query_big_query(query_string):
    client = bigquery.Client()
    query_job = client.query(query_string)

    results = query_job.result()  # Waits for job to complete.
    return results


# ## Question 1
# 1) Use the publicly available BigQuery dataset named `nyc-tlc.green.trips_2015`, provide SQL queries to answer the following questions:
# * What is the total amount and passenger counts for the months of February, March and April?
# * What has been the average hourly passenger count throughout the year?  
# * What has been the change/delta in total amount billed over days? What we would like see is how much (positive or negative)
# * What hour of the day has seen the longest rides in April?

# ## Question 1.1 
# * What is the total amount and passenger counts for the months of February, March and April?

# ### Discussion of the Problem
# 
# I initally approached this problem somewhat naively.  I did not consider the possibliity of taxi rides overlapping per hour.  
# 
# For example the code below simply considered the pickup_datetime in the analysis.

# ### Discussion of the Clean Data
# 
# As we can the see the cleaned data is far more usable.  Typically, I would have performed analysis across a spark cluster or pandas if the resource requirements were not too great.

# Another approach would have been to export the table to another bigtable instance.   I may experiment with this approach if I have time.

# ### Discussion of the Solution to Problem 1.1
# 
# The resulting data can is accurate to the month.  It is also account for cases when rides overlap across datetimes.  For example, if a ride begins at 12:00 but ends at 14:00, the query above will count the ridership at hours 12 and 13.   
# 
# The one drawback to this approach is that it can in theory inflate the total_amount value.  If considering 1 minute intervals as opposed to an hour the rate of hour expands the total_amount value too greatly.  The solution to the problem would be to work with the rate to recalculate the total amount per hour, minute, etc.  Thankfully, as most rides are less than an hour long, it is uncecessary for the question posed.

# ### Discussion of Question 1.3
# 
# The approach is almost identical to my previous answers.  The only major difference is the inclusion of the lag function to determine the running differences.  

# 

# ## Question 1.4
# 
# * What hour of the day has seen the longest rides in April?
# 

# ### Date_trunc Method
# 
# Date_trunc will return the requested results per date per hour.

# #### Discussion of Date Trunc Method

# I wanted to see if avg_trip_duration would correlate with avg_trip_distance.  
# 
# In this sample it does seem to. I would like to test the distributions later for correlation. 
# 
# To answer the question, 2014-04-22 at 5:00 am recorded the longest trips.  Interestingly, most of longest trips are at 5:00.  I expected the evening rush hour to record a larger number of results. As this is the green line, it would make sense that a large majority of taking the vehicle to the airport or to a determined destination as opposed to randomly hailing a yellow cab.  
# 
# Review the code below for a results below for a more succint table.  
# 

# ### The Extract Method
# 
# Extract will record the values by hour of the 24 hour clock.  It will aggregate accordinly.
