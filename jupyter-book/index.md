# Justin Napolitano's Technical Submission to PMC

Thank you for considering for the data analyst role at PMC. 


Please review the contents below for the solutions to the technical questions presented to me.  


I also included a logistic regression based propensity model of customer churn rate prepared in the Julia language.  I did this over the weekend to familiarize myself with google analytics data.  I hope you find it interesting.
