# Justin Napolitano

Thank you for considering me for the data analyst role at PMC. 

In preparation for this discussion, I questioned why I would like to work for Penske.  I wrote a pensive letter in an attempt to answer that question. 

As such, I have reorganized this site to present that letter in part 1.  

Part 2 is a cost of living model that I presented to get an idea of what I would like to earn in order to maintain my current standard of living.  Frankly, I am very uncomfortable with negotiating salary.  Especially without clearly defined ranges.   I present that model to you to justify my expectations.

Part 3 contains the answers to the technical questions presented to me prior to my discussion with Chelsea and Tynelle.  

I also included some examples of my other work below the table of contents.
